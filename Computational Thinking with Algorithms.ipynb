    "An _in-place_ sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output. It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list. When all data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed in-memory at a time, the sorting is called _external sorting_. External Sorting is used for massive amount of data. When all data is placed in-memory, then sorting is called _internal sorting._\n",

    "Second comparison based sorting algorithm e.g. QuickSort, Merge Sort. or Heap Sort requires a Comparator to sort elements e.g. while sorting an array of String, but non-comparison based sorting algorithms doesn't require any comparator.\n",
