    "\n",
    "An _in-place_ sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output. It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list. When all data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed in-memory at a time, the sorting is called _external sorting_. External Sorting is used for massive amount of data. When all data is placed in-memory, then sorting is called _internal sorting._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Stability_ is mainly important when we have key value pairs with duplicate keys possible (like people names as keys and their details as values). And we wish to sort these objects by keys. So, stability means that equivalent elements retain their relative positions, after sorting.\n",

    "A **comparison sort** is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a \"less than or equal to\" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort\n",

The limit of speed for comparison-based sorting algorithm is O(NlogN) while for non-comparison based algorithms its O(n) i.e. linear time.\n",
    "Second comparison based sorting algorithm e.g. QuickSort, Merge Sort. or Heap Sort requires a Comparator to sort elements e.g. while sorting an array of String, but non-comparison based sorting algorithms doesn't require any comparator.\n",
    "Non-Comparison based sorting algorithm can use to sort any object provided. A non-comparison based sorting algorithm can not be used to sort anything other than integers, that's why they are also known as integer sorting.\n",
    "The best case for memory complexity with the comparison based sorting is O(1) because it's possible to sort an array of numbers in place. On the other hand, memory complexity for non-comparison based sorting algorithm is always O(n).\n",
